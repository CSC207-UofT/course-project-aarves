# Specification #

Our goal is to create an app that is tailored to UofT students, allowing them to browse restaurants and study spots on the St. George Campus. The app allows students to leave reviews and view the reviews of other students for each location.

-   To browse the app, users can either create an account, login, or continue as a guest (no account).

### All users should be able to: ###
