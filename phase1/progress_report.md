# Design Document #

## Specification ##

Our goal is to create an app that is tailored to UofT students, allowing them to browse restaurants and study spots on the St. George Campus. The app allows students to leave reviews and view the reviews of other students for each location.

-   To browse the app, users can either create an account, login, or continue as a guest (no account).

### All users should be able to: ###

-   View a list of study and food locations recommended to them.

-   Search locations, and use the provided filter to narrow their search for a location.

-   Use the interactable map to browse locations near them.

### All users with an account should be able to: ###

-   Bookmark a location for future viewing

-   Leave a review and rating for each location

### Locations ###

-   Each location displays information regarding the location (address, name of location).

-   Food location includes the food type, dine-in/take out options and the price range

-   Study location includes whether it is indoors or outdoors and if there are study rooms available

## Functionality added between phase 0 and phase 1 ##

The app now has an Android UI. The user is now able to use the interactable map toÂ  browse locations at the St. George campus.
