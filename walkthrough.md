# Scenario Walk-through

Upon entry to the app, you can either Login, Sign-up, or Continue as Guest. If Sign-up is selected, **AccountCreator** uses **AccountManager** to check if the account exists. If not, **AccountCreator** takes an inputted username and password, creates a **RegisteredUser**, and stores it in **AccountManager**. If Login is selected, a username and password is taken, **AccountManager** verifies it, and processes a successful log in (if not, you see a message hinting that either the username or the password is incorrect). If Continue as Guest is selected, you’re brought past the login menu into the app as a **GuestUser**. Once in the main app, both **GuestUser** and **RegisteredUser** can browse **Map** for any **Location**. If specific filters are selected, you can look for a **FoodLocation** on the **FoodMap**, or a **StudyLocation** on the **StudyMap**. Only **RegisteredUser** can leave a **Review** on a **Location** and bookmark them, meanwhile a **GuestUser** can simply view what’s available.
