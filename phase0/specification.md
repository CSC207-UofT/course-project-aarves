# Specification

- Starting the application gives the user the option to either log in, create account, or continue as guest (no account).

- Upon getting past the first menu (account login/sign-up-related), the user can look for places to eat, study, or both, on campus and in the nearby vicinity.

    - All users are able to use the map to look for specific types of locations (i.e. food-only or study-only), and apply filters to help with their search.
    - A user who's logged on is able to bookmark, and review these places (in addition to deleting their bookmarks and reviews).
    - A review can either have no opinion-piece and leave just a score, or include the opinion-piece.

- The app will use location and map functionality, either from within the Android SDK, or external API providers (i.e. MapBox), to allow functionality of the map.
