## Potential Customers for our Project ##
This project is marketed toward University of Toronto (St. George) students, as this app was designed solely for students to use to find better food places and study areas around the St. George campus. 

## Is our project less likely to be used by a certain demographic? ##
Yes, people who are not University of Toronto St. George students are not likely to use this app, since they will not need to go to the St. George campus on a near-daily basis.
